Hanggame is a classic console-based game implemented in C++. The objective of the game is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The catch is that the player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before a stick figure (representing a hangman) is fully drawn, resulting in the player's loss.
